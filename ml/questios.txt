Why is naive bayes called “naive” ? 
Tell me about naive bayes classifier ?
What is deep learning ? Difference between machine learning & Deep learning ?
Experience: There were few more questions like this but it went terrible for me. I really could not get what his expectation was as he was not going technical at all where as I was trying to dig deep into technical stuff. I tried discussing about training a tesseract or language models but he does not seem to be convinced. May be he wanted to hear something out of box or may be just good explanations or may be some better approach. I did not get the difference between getting interviewed as fresher and experienced professional as I was taking it for the first time in last 5 years.

Okay that is the baseline people start with ? What can you do more with machine learning ? (I tried suggesting LSTM with word2vec or 1D-CNN with word2vec for classification but he wanted improvements in machine learning based methods :-|)
How does neural networks learns non-linear shapes when it is made of linear nodes ? What makes it learn non-linear boundaries ?
Experience: There were few more good questions which I do not remember now. Though the interview discussion was fantastic, in some of the questions we were not on same platform. Also during the interview I found out that being a startup there were only 2-3 people working in ML/DL/DS and showed the concern to the interviewer. I was not selected for the position here.

Experience: This was Amazon interview for level 6 position. All I can say that it was mainly focused on algorithms and their mathematics behind them. Unfortunately, I was taking all interviews extempore and was not in a position to discuss all the mathematics in detailed way. Though I really enjoyed the interview discussing at least all the methodologies and mathematical explanations (which i remembered), the interviewer does not find me suitable for Level 6 position. I suppose one can easily crack initial technical round if you brush up the common machine learning algorithms in detail.

So, the whole 1 hour of interview went on discussing the speech analytics domain. Obviously, He was very well convinced with the work and gave positive feedback for the interview. I was offered AI solution architect job position after one more round with co-founders.    

Suggestions
I have spoken to almost 25-30 professionals working in this fields during this job change process in order to explore all my options. Having said that, I would suggest the following tips which may support the job seekers and readers.

Your CV is very important. I will thrust on this again. Start building your profile impressive with projects, Kaggle competitions, MOOC certifications, research papers (if possible). I got call from amazon without any reference. Your CV can impress HR’s and interviewer right away. It is certainly hard to get picked for interview in good companies without reference.
Your confidence and drive that you carry will do half of the job. It’s very important to take interview with confidence and show that you have that drive. Personally I felt it matters in interviews (specially in startups and services based ones).
While in interview do not rush into answers. Take your time in thinking about questions and then answer suitably. Ask questions if you do not understand the question properly. You may need to calm down in interviews (that’s an issue with me sometimes)
Express yourself while explaining concepts properly. Give examples from projects you may have implemented. You must be thorough with the skills and projects written in CV.
Mostly, Employer looks for experienced candidates in this field. If you are a beginner then try to build your profile by implementing applications on your own. Your Github account can say a lot. Do participate in lot of Kaggle competitions. Take online MOOC certifications.
Lastly try to be modest with interviewer and nod to their opinions sometimes otherwise it may land you in rejections. You may find people arrogant sometimes. For an example, R or Python enthusiasts are sentimental about respective languages. It is better not to fall in such debate. Personally I feel these are tools to accomplish your logic and concepts.
